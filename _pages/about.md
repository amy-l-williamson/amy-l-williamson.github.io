Hi there! I am a postdoctoral research at the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/).

## Earthquake Early Warning
The closest, most well-visited moon in the solar system is located in our own backyard. During its ~29 day orbit around Earth, the Moon experiences a wide range of magnetic field and plasma environments. During approximately 5 days each month, the Moon is embedded deep within the lobes of the terrestrial magnetotail. Although the Moon’s exosphere is orders of magnitude less dense than Earth, the lunar exospheric density dominates compared to the tenuous magnetotail plasma. I have focused on constraining and understanding this type of interaction, to understand what it can tell us not only about the lunar atmosphere, but also about the low-energy plasma outflowing from Earth’s ionosphere.

## Tsunami Modeling
My dissertation topic focused on Jupiter’s icy moon Callisto. Specifically, I use hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) modeling techniques in combination with energetic test-particle simulations to study Callisto’s interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. I have recently expanded my studies to investigate the icy moons Ganymede and Europa, as well. By comparing output from my models to data from the magnetometer, plasma spectrometer, and energetic particle detector data obtained during the [Galileo](https://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/) mission to Jupiter, I am able to provide insight into the search for water beneath the surfaces of these three icy moons. My research has introduced a method to disentangle signatures of plasma interaction and induction in magnetic field data, which is paramount in determining properties of subsurface, liquid water oceans. For Callisto, my research has identified a method to identify a signature of its subsurface ocean in energetic particle data, which can be used in concert with magnetometer data to help constrain the moon’s inductive response.

I am involved with the European Space Agency’s upcoming [JUpiter Icy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission](http://sci.esa.int/juice/), where I provide modeling support to help determine flyby trajectories that will be optimal to characterize the inductive responses of the Galilean moons.
