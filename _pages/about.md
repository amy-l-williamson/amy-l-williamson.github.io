Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/). My research combines seismology, geodesy, and oceanography to study all things earthquakes and tsunamis. I am particularly interested in the real time characterization of geophysical processes to create informed early warning alerts.

## Position

2024 - Present: research scientist, Berkeley Seismological Laboratory

2021 - 2024: postdoctoral researcher, Berkeley Seismological Laboratory

2020 - 2021: duty scientist, National Tsunami Warning Center

2018 - 2020: postdoctoral researcher, University of Oregon

## Education
2018: PhD in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georiga Institute of Technology

2013: BS in Geosciences, Denison University

## Research Interests
Keywords: natural hazards, earthquake early warning, tsunami modeling, GNSS

My research interests have focused on a variety of techniques to improve our understanding of earthquake source processes through the merging of both submarine and terrestrial datasets. I have a particular interest in studying tsunamigenic events because of their large scale impact on communities on an ocean basin scale. 

#### Earthquake Early Warning

The ShakeAlert EEW system rapidly locates and characterizes earthquakes using real time data from broadband and strong-motion seismometers. Within seconds of an earthquake rupture, alerts can be sent to users warning of potential shaking, often before the arrival of the more damaging S-wave. These alerts are crucial for people in areas where potentially damaging shaking can ocur, allowing for proactive action to mitigate risk. As a postdoctoral researcher and now as a research scientist, I actively work to improve the real-time characterization of earthquakes within ShakeAlert. To date, I have:
- developed a real-time weighting scheme to improve earthquake location estimates in the ShakeAlert EEW algorithm, EPIC
Earthquake Early Warning (EEW)
- created updated station magnitude scaling relations to better characterize station magnitudes from near-field stations in ShakeAlert
- developed per-station site corrections to account for localized amplification

#### Tsunami Modeling & Tsunami Early Warning

- probabilistic tsunami hazard modeling using event clustering
- landslide generated tsunami hazard assessments for the Barry Arm and greater Prince William Sound, Alaska
- high resolution tsunami modeling including complex earthquake rupture parameters
  
#### Geodesy
- developing quality control tools to analyze real-time on-board positions within the BARD GNSS network
- testing the efficacy of rapid GNSS data products for use in earthquake and tsunami early warning algorithms
