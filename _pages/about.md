Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/). My research combines seismology, geodesy, and oceanography to study all things earthquakes and tsunamis. I am particularly interested in the real time characterization of geophysical processes to create informed hazard early warning alerts.

## Position
2024 - Present: research scientist, Berkeley Seismological Laboratory
2021 - 2024: postdoctoral researcher, Berkeley Seismological Laboratory
2020 - 2021: duty scientist, National Tsunami Warning Center
2018 - 2020: postdoctoral researcher, University of Oregon

## Education


## Research Interests
======

My research interests have focused on a variety of techniques to improve our understanding of earthquake source processes through the merging of both submarine and terrestrial datasets. I have a particular interest in studying tsunamigenic events because of their large scale impact on communities on an ocean basin scale. 

## Earthquake Early Warning

Earthquake Early Warning (EEW)

The ShakeAlert EEW system rapidly locates and characterizes earthquakes using real time data from broadband and strong-motion seismometers. Within seconds of an earthquake rupture, alerts can be sent to users warning of potential shaking, often before the arrival of the more damaging S-wave. These alerts are crucial for people in areas where potentially damaging shaking can ocur, allowing for proactive action to mitigate risk.
