Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/).


Research Interests
======

My research interests have focused on a variety of techniques to improve our understanding of earthquake source processes through the merging of both submarine and terrestrial datasets. I have a particular interest in studying tsunamigenic events because of their large scale impact on communities on an ocean basin scale. 

## Earthquake Early Warning

Earthquake Early Warning (EEW)

The ShakeAlert EEW system rapidly locates and characterizes earthquakes using real time data from broadband and strong-motion seismometers. Within seconds of an earthquake rupture, alerts can be sent to users warning of potential shaking, often before the arrival of the more damaging S-wave. These alerts are crucial for people in areas where potentially damaging shaking can ocur, allowing for proactive action to mitigate risk.
