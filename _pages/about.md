Hi there! I am a postdoctoral research at the [Berkeley Seismological Laboratory](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/).


Active Research Interests
======

My research interests have focused on a variety of techniques to improve our understanding of earthquake source processes through the merging of both submarine and terrestrial datasets. I have a particular interest in studying tsunamigenic events because of their large scale impact on communities on an ocean basin scale.
