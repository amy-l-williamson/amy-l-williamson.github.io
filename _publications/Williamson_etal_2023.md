In order to better constrain location solutions in this region, we propose to include information about contemporary past seismicity into EPIC’s grid search algorithm through a Bayesian framework. This prior information layer down-weights high error locations where EPIC’s proposed event location coincides with an area of low prior seismicity in preference for locations with a similar level of data fit that also have higher past seismicity. This addition to EPIC lowers the mean location error offshore northern California from 58 km to 14 km.
