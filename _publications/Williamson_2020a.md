In this study, we take the first steps to systematically analyze thequality of nearfield tsunami forecasts that would rely on earthquake source products derived from high-rate and real time GNSS data for potential earthquakes originating on the Cascadia margin. Specifically, we focus on two aspects. First, we analyze the ability of regional GNSS sensors to rapidly estimate characteristics of an offshore earthquake such as magnitude, focal mechanism, and fault slip. Second, we show how well automated GNSS-driven slip models can reproduce observed tsunami amplitudes at local coastlines, proposing an assessment method based on user defined thresholds that we believe is beneficial for local tsunami warning.
