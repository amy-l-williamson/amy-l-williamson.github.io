In thisIn this study, we posit that subaerial, submarine landslides, and coseismic offsets all contributed to the 2018 Palu, Indonesia tsunami’s damaging impact. We explore many
possible tsunami sources in addition to the earthquake’s rupture near the bay, solving for both coseismic offsets and potential landsliding events in a self-consistent model.
