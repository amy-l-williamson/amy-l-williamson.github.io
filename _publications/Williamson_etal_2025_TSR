In this study, we compare bEPIC’s ability to detect and locate offshore earthquakes from the M 7.0 earthquake sequence against the EPIC solution. We focus on location accuracy, rates of earthquake detection, downstream parameter improvements to the magnitude, and first alert timing. We also highlight how utilizing bEPIC improves the potential alerting footprint. The performance during this sequence can act as an example of expected performance for future large earthquakes within this seismically active region.
