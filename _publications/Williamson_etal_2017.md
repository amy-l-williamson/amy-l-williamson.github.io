Through a transcoastal geodetic study, including tsunami time series recorded at open ocean pressure gauges, subaerial deformation observed through interferometric synthetic aperture radar from the Sentinel-1 A satellite and continuous GPS, we identify the location and extent of coseismic slip from the 2015 Illapel, Chile earthquake.
